    <title>Integers, Rationals, and Reals</title>
    <p>A <term>real number</term> is a number that represents a location on the continuous number line. We refer to the collection of all real numbers as the <term>set of real numbers</term> and denote this by the symbol <m>\mathbb{R}</m>.
    <image source="images/thirdparty/realnumberline" width="50%"/>
    Within the set of real numbers are special categories of numbers you should be familiar with. The <term>set of natural numbers</term> includes the counting numbers and zero:
    <me>0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots .</me>
    If we also include their <em>opposite</em>, we obtain the <term>set of integers</term>:
    <me>\ldots, -5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \ldots .</me>
    If we form <term>ratios</term> of integers, i.e. fractions involving integers, we obtain the <term>set of rational numbers</term>.</p>

    <example>
        <title>Rational Numbers</title>
        <statement>
        <p>The following real numbers are rational numbers:
        <me>\frac{7}{10} = 0.7,\quad \quad\frac{2}{3} = 0.6666\ldots, \quad \quad  \frac{-20}{5} = - 4.</me>
        Every integer is a rational number as it can be written as a ratio in many ways. For example,
        <me>-4 = \frac{-4}{1} = \frac{4}{-1} = \frac{-20}{5}.</me>
        Even zero is a rational number, since dividing zero by any non-zero integer results in zero:
        <me>0 = \frac{0}{1} = \frac{0}{-50}.</me>
      </p></statement>
    </example>
    
    <warning xml:id="warning-division-by-zero">
      <title>Division by Zero is Undefined</title>
      <p>You must <alert>never divide a real number by zero</alert>. Expressions such as <q><m>1/0</m></q> or <q><m>0/0</m></q> are considered to be <term>undefined</term> in that they are assigned no numeric value and have no mathematical meaning.</p>
      <p>Division <em>into zero</em> by a non-zero real number is permitted and results in zero. For instance, <m>0/1 = 0</m>.
      </p>
    </warning>

    <p>A real number which is <em>not</em> rational is called an <term>irrational</term> number. Irrational numbers are everywhere on the real line, filling up the gaps between the rationals numbers. Many famous constants are irrational, such as <m>\sqrt{2}</m>, <m>\pi</m>, and <m>e</m>.</p>

    <title>Decimal Representations</title>
    <p>A real number like <m>3.1459</m>, which can be written with a finite number of digits, is shorthand for a sum of rational numbers:
    <md>
        <mrow>3.1459 \amp= \underbrace{3}_{\text{integer part}} 
          + \underbrace{\frac{1}{10}}_{\text{tenths}} 
          + \underbrace{\frac{4}{100}}_{\text{hundreths}} 
          + \underbrace{\frac{5}{1000}}_{\text{thousandths}} 
          + \underbrace{\frac{9}{10000}}_{\text{ten thousandths}}</mrow>
        <mrow>\amp= 3 + \frac{1459}{10000} =  \frac{31459}{10000}.</mrow>
    </md>
    In fact, every <em>rational number</em> has a <term>decimal representation</term> provided we allow the digits to eventually repeat a regular pattern infinitely often. We write a bar over the digits that repeat.</p>

    <example>
        <title>Decimal Representations of Rationals</title>
        <statement><p>The following examples provide decimal representations of some rational numbers.
        <me>\frac{1}{2} = 0.5000\ldots = 0.5\overline{0} = 0.5</me>
        <me>\frac{2}{3} = 0.6666\ldots = 0.\overline{6}</me>
        <me>\frac{12}{37} = 0.324\,324\,324\ldots = 0.\overline{324}</me>
        <me>\frac{381}{148} = 2.57\,432\,432\,432\ldots = 2.57\overline{432}</me></p></statement>
    </example>

    <p>The relationship between the decimal representation of a rational number (and what it even means to have an infinitely long decimal representation) requires some concepts we won't discuss until calculus. For now, I'd like you to be aware of the following fact.</p>

    <fact xml:id="fact-decimal-representation-of-rationals">
      <title>Decimal Representation of Rational Numbers</title>
        <statement><p>A real number is rational if and only if it has a decimal representation that eventually repeats a regular sequence of digits.</p>
        <p> Accordingly, a real number is irrational if and only if it's impossible to express it in a decimal form with a regularly repeating sequence of digits.</p></statement>
    </fact>

    <example xml:id="example-pi-irrational">
      <title><m>\pi</m> is irrational</title>
      <statement>
        <p>Draw a perfect circle of any size. Measure the length of its diameter (the distance across the circle through the center) and its circumference (the distance around the circle).
        <!-- Third Party Image -->
        <image source="images/thirdparty/pi" width="25%"/>
        If you divide the circumference <m>C</m> by the diameter <m>d</m> you will always obtain the same number called <m>\pi</m> ("pi")
        <me>\pi = \frac{C}{d}.</me> 
        In fact, <m>\pi</m> is an irrational number. The decimal representation of 
        <m>\pi</m> begins with <me>\pi = 3.1459\ldots,</me> but never terminates or infinitely repeats a fixed sequence of digits. We can at best approximate its value with a finite number of digits which we could indicate as <me>\pi \approx 3.1459</me> where <m>\approx</m> is used to indicate an approximation.

    <example xml:id="example-reciprocal-pi-irrational">
      <title>Mathematical Reasoning</title>
      <statement>
      <p>
        Given that <m>\pi</m> is irrational, what about other expressions that involve 
        <m>\pi</m>? For instance, is it possible that <m>1/\pi</m> is suddenly rational? Prove that can't be the case!
      </p>
      </statement>
      <solution>
        <p>
        Let's assume that <m>1/\pi</m> it is rational and see what happens. This would mean that there are integers <m>p</m> and <m>q\neq 0</m>, such that
        <me>\frac{1}{\pi} = \frac{p}{q}.</me>
        Note that <m>p \neq 0</m> because <m>1/\pi</m> is not zero. Taking the reciprocal of both sides gives
        <me>\pi = \frac{q}{p}</me>
        from which we could conclude that <m>\pi</m> is <em>rational</em>, a contradiction. Thus, <m>1/\pi</m> must be irrational after all.

      <p>We combine real numbers using arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

    <title>Properties of Real Numbers</title>

    <p>The real numbers and the arithmetic operations we perform with them fundamental properties that you should be aware of.</p>

    <principle><title>Properties of Real Numbers</title>
      <statement>
      <p> 
        <ul>
          <li><em>Commutativity</em>: <m>a+b=b+a</m> and <m>ab = ba</m></li>
          <li><em>Associativity</em>: <m>a+(b+c)=(a+b)+c</m> and <m>a(bc) = (ab)c</m></li>
          <li><em>Distributivity</em>: <m>a(b+c) = ab+ac</m> and <m>(a+b)c = ac+bc</m></li>
        </ul>
      </p></statement></principle>

    <example>
      <title>Using Commutativity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Commutativity says it doesn't matter the order you add or the order you multiply real numbers, as the results will be the same. 
          For addition:
          <me>-2 + 7 = 7+(-2) = 7-2 =5.</me>
          For multiplication:
          <me>-2\cdot 7 = 7(-2) = -14.</me>
    </p></statement></example>

    <example>
      <title>Using Associativity</title>
      <statement>
        <p>
          Associativity says the way you group multiple additions or products together doesn't matter. This ensures that it makes perfect sense to drop parenthesis altogether as in the following example involving addition:
          <me>-2+7+3 = -2+(7+3) = -2 + 10 = 8.</me>
          This is the same if computed as
          <me>-2+7+3 = (-2+7)+3 = 5+3 = 8.</me>
          Similarly for multiplication,
          <me>-2\cdot 7\cdot 3 = (-2\cdot 7)\cdot 3 = -14\cdot 3 =-42.</me>
          Or, equivalently
          <me>-2\cdot 7\cdot 3 = -2\cdot (7\cdot 3) = -2\cdot 21 =-42.</me>

    <title>Terms versus Factors</title>

    <introduction><p>This section emphasizes the importance of correctly identifying the parts of an algebraic expression. Carefully use the words "term" and "factor" accurately to avoid many pitfalls in algebra.</p></introduction>

    <p><em>Repeated addition</em> of a number gives a <term>multiple</term> of that number. Each occurrence of the number is a <term>term</term> in the sum.</p>

    <example><title>Repeated Addition</title>
    <statement><p>In this case, there are 5 terms of 2 resulting in 10.
      <me>\underbrace{2+2+2+2+2}_{\text{$5$ terms of $2$}} = \underbrace{5\cdot 2}_{\text{A multiple of $2$}} = 10.</me>
      </p></statement>
    </example>

    <p><em>Repeated multiplication</em> of a number gives a <term>power</term> of that number. Each occurrence of the number is a <term>factor</term> in the product.</p>

    <example>
        <title>Repeated Multiplication</title>
        <statement><p>In this case, there are 5 factors of 2 resulting in 32.
        <me>\underbrace{2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2\cdot 2}_{\text{$5$ factors of $2$}} = \underbrace{2^5}_{\text{a power of $2$}} = 32.</me>
        The number of factors, <m>5</m>, in the power <m>2^5</m> is called its 
        <term>exponent</term>. The number <m>2</m> in the power is called the <term>base</term> of the power.</p></statement>
    </example>

    <definition><title>Terms and Factors</title>
        <statement><p>Whenever we add (or subtract) real numbers  
          <me>a+b+c+\cdots</me>
          the individual numbers <m>a,b,c,\ldots</m> are called 
          <term>terms</term> in the sum. Whenever we multiply (or divide) real numbers
          <me>a\times b\times c\times \cdots</me>
          the numbers <m>a,b,c,\ldots</m> are called 
          <term>factors</term> in the product. 
          An expression of the form <m>a^b</m> is called a

        </p></statement>
    </definition>

    <example xml:id="example-cancelling"><title>Canceling</title>
    <statement>
    <p>It's crucial that you distinguish between 
      <em>terms in a sum</em>
      versus 
      <em>factors in a product</em>. For instance, you may 
      <em>cancel the common factors</em>
      of 
      <m>2</m>
      in the ratio:
  
      <me>\frac{3\cdot 2}{2} = 3.</me>
      However, you must never cancel common terms in a ratio. For instance, do not cancel the common terms of 
      <m>2</m>
      in the ratio 
      <m>\frac{3+2}{2}</m>. Instead,
      <me>\frac{3+2}{2} = \frac{5}{2}.</me></p></statement></example>

    <p>If <m>a</m> is a real number, then <m>-a</m> is its <term>opposite</term>
      value and appears at the same, but opposite location on the real line.

      I recommend you resist the urge to refer to 
      <m>-a</m>
      as 
      <q><em>negative</em>
      <m>a</m></q>
      as it is unclear if the result is positive or negative. For instance, the opposite of 
      <m>-4</m>
      is 
      <m>-(-4) = 4</m>, a positive integer. Adding a number with its opposite results in zero:
      <me>a + (-a) = 0.</me>
      It is for this reason that 
      <m>-a</m>
      is sometimes called the 
      <term>additive inverse</term>
      of 
      <m>a</m>.</p>
    <p>If 
      <m>a</m>
      is non-zero (see 
      <xref ref="warning-division-by-zero"/>
      ) real number, then 
      <m>1/a</m>
      is called its 
      <term>reciprocal</term>. Multiplying 
      <m>a</m>
      by its reciprocal results in one:
  
      <me>a \times \frac{1}{a} = 1.</me>
      It is for this reason that 
      <m>1/a</m>
      is sometimes called the 
      <term>multiplicative inverse</term>
      of 
      <m>a</m>. For instance, <m>2</m> is the multiplicative inverse of <m>1/2</m> because <m>2\times (1/2) = 1</m>.</p>

      <p>The reciprocal of a rational number interchanges the numerator and denominator:
      <me>\frac{1}{\frac{2}{3}} = \frac{1}{2/3} = \frac{3}{2}.</me>
      The opposite of a rational number can be formed with the opposite of the numerator or denominator. That is, the following are all equal:
      <me>- \left(\frac{2}{3}\right) = -\frac{2}{3} = \frac{-2}{3} = \frac{2}{-3}.</me>

      <title>Square Roots</title>
      <p>We can write 
        <m>9</m> as a square in two different ways:
        <me>9 = 3^2 \quad \text{and} \quad 9 = (-3)^2.</me> 
        We call <m>3</m> and <m>-3</m> <term>square roots</term>
        of <m>9</m>. Notice I said <q>square roots</q> and not <q>the square root</q>! 
        One of these, <m>3</m>, is positive; and the other, 
        <m>-3</m>, is negative. We use the symbol <m>\sqrt{9}</m> specifically for the positive square root and call it the <term xml:id="term-principal-square-root">principal square root</term>
        of <m>9</m>. So <m>\sqrt{9} = 3</m>.</p>

      <p>Note that the other square root of <m>9</m> is the opposite of its principal square root, namely <m>-\sqrt{9} = -3</m>. There are exactly two square roots of <m>9</m>, <m>\sqrt{9}</m> and 
      <m>-\sqrt{9}</m>. This is summarized by saying the square roots of <m>9</m> are <m>\pm\sqrt{9}</m>, where the <m>\pm</m> is read as <q>plus or minus</q>. </p>

      <p>To put things another way, the real number solutions to the equation 
        <m>x^2 = 9</m>
        are 
        <m>x= \pm\sqrt{9}</m>:
        <men xml:id="equation-square-root-principle">x^2 = 9 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = \pm \sqrt{9} = \pm 3.</men></p>
      <p>Now consider 
        <m>-9</m>, a negative number. Since the square of any real number is never negative, 
        <m>-9</m>
        has no real number square roots and the symbol 
        <m>\sqrt{-9}</m>
        is 
        <em>undefined</em>. To put things another way, the equation 
        <m>x^2 = -9</m>
        has no real number solutions.</p>
      <p>Finally, observe that 
        <m>0^2 = 0</m>, so that 
        <m>0</m>
        is a square root of itself. This is the only square root of zero, so that 
        <m>\sqrt{0} = 0</m>.</p>

      <statement>
        <p>The equation

          has exactly two real number solution 
          <m>x=\pm \sqrt{15}</m>. These numbers are irrational, but may be approximated with a calculator or computer. Using the square root button, I found that 
          <m>\sqrt{15} \approx 3.87</m>, approximately. The solutions are approximately 
          <m>x \approx 3.87</m>
          and 
          <m>x \approx - 3.87</m>. That is,

        and 
        <m>x</m>

      <title>Interval Notation</title>
      <p>
        We frequently need to describe sets of real numbers that form contiguous segments along the real number line called <term>intervals</term>. For instance, all the real numbers <m>x</m> that satisfies the inequalities 
        <me>x \geq -5 \quad \text{AND}\quad x \lt 2</me>
        forms an interval that includes <m>-5</m> and all real numbers to right on the number line up to and excluding <m>2</m>. Graphically, this can be plotted as we see below.
        <image source="images/realnumbers/m5-2" width="60%"></image>
        Note the use of a open circle and closed circle to indicate the behavior at the endpoints of the interval.
      </p>
      <p>
        Describing these types of sets is so useful that we have special notation for this called <term>interval notation</term>. For example, the interval graphed above is written as <m>[-5,2)</m>, where we use a bracket next to 
        <m>-5</m> to indicate that it is <em>included</em> in the set and a parenthesis next to <m>2</m> to indicate that it is <em>excluded</em> from the set.

    <title>Unions and Intersections</title>
    <p>We may combine two intervals in two different ways: by forming their <em>union</em> or <em>intersection</em>. First, the <term>union</term> of two intervals consists of all real numbers that are in one OR both of the intervals. Graphically, this combines the two intervals into a (usually) larger set which may or may not be an interval. We use the symbol <q><m>\cup</m></q> to denote the union of two sets.</p>

    <example>
      <title>Finding a Union</title> 
      <statement><p>
        The union of <m>[-3,1]</m> and <m>(0,+\infty)</m>
        <image source="images/realnumbers/union1" width="60%"></image>
        results in the interval <m>[-3,+\infty)</m>.
        <image source="images/realnumbers/union2" width="60%"></image>
        This is written as
        <me>[-3,1] \cup (0,+\infty) = [-3,+\infty).</me></p></statement>
    </example>

    <p>The <term>intersection</term> of two intervals consists of all real numbers that are in both of the intervals. It is the set of all real numbers they have in common. The symbol for intersection is <q><m>\cap</m></q>.</p> 

    <example><title>Finding an Intersection</title>
      <statement><p>The intersection of <m>[-3,1]</m>
        and <m>(0,+\infty)</m> is <m>(0,1]</m>
        <image source="images/realnumbers/intersection" width="60%"></image>
        and this result is written as
        <me>[-3,1] \cap (0,+\infty) = (0,1].</me></p></statement>
    </example>
    
     <p>If two sets have nothing in common, their intersection is the <term>empty set</term>, that is the set containing no real numbers. This is denoted by the symbol <m>\emptyset</m>. </p>

     <example>
      <statement>
        <p>The interval of <m>(-\infty,-3]</m> and <m>(0,1]</m> do not overlap.
        <image source="images/realnumbers/intersection2" width="60%"/>
        So their intersection is empty:
        <me>(-\infty,-3] \cap (0,1] = \emptyset.</me>        
     </p></statement></example>
      
    <remark>
        <p>The intersection or union of two intervals does not itself need to be an interval. For instance, 
          <me>(-\infty,-3)\cup (0,1]</me>
          is just comprised of real numbers in one of the two intervals above and cannot be written more simply than this.</p>
